# 21Kernels - Vote for your 21 most favourite Bitcoin quotes

## Introduction
21Kernels provides users a platform to vote for their 21 most favourite Bitcoin quotes. The '21' in the name comes from Bitcoin's fixed supply of 21 million coins - this fixed supply is in part why Bitcoin is superior to any other form of money, be it gold or fiat currency, as their supply is not fixed. The 'Kernels' part references the meme of Bitcoin being sometimes refered to as 'corn'. 

The website is simple: provide users with 21 corn, where 1 corn = 1 vote, and hundreds of quotes about Bitcoin to vote for. Which quote will reign supreme?
